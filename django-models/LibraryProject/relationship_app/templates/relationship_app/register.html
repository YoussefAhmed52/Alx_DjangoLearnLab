In this project, “Deep Dive into Django Models and Views,” you will advance your skills in using Django, a high-level Python web framework. This project is designed for novice learners aiming to solidify their understanding of Django’s ORM capabilities, view configurations, and user authentication features. Through a series of hands-on tasks, you will implement complex model relationships, develop both function-based and class-based views, and manage user authentication and permissions. By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build robust and scalable web applications using Django.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Implement Advanced Model Relationships in Django:

Master Django’s ORM capabilities by creating models that demonstrate ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and OneToOne relationships.
Effectively model complex data relationships in a Django project.
Develop Django Views and URL Configuration:

Gain proficiency in creating function-based and class-based views in Django.
Configure URL patterns to handle web requests effectively, routing them to the appropriate views.
Manage User Authentication in Django:

Set up user login, logout, and registration functionalities using Django’s built-in authentication system.
Develop views and templates to demonstrate user session and permission management.
Implement Role-Based Access Control in Django:

Extend the Django User model to include user roles and create views that restrict access based on these roles.
Utilize Django signals to automatically create a UserProfile when a new user is registered.
Implement Custom Permissions in Django:

Add custom permissions to the Book model to control actions such as adding, editing, and deleting entries based on user roles.
Enforce these permissions in views, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions.
Tasks
0. Implementing Advanced Model Relationships in Django
mandatory
Objective: Master Django’s ORM capabilities by creating a set of models that demonstrate the use of ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and OneToOne relationships. This task will help you understand how to model complex data relationships in a Django project effectively.

Task Description:
Duplicate the previous project directory Introduction_ to_ Django, rename it to django-models and add a new app named relationship_app where you’ll define models that showcase complex relationships between entities using ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and OneToOne fields.

Steps:
Create the relationship_app App:

Within your Django project directory, generate a new app: python manage.py startapp relationship_app.
Define Complex Models in relationship_app/models.py:

Author Model:
name: CharField.
Book Model:
title: CharField.
author: ForeignKey to Author.
Library Model:
name: CharField.
books: ManyToManyField to Book.
Librarian Model:
name: CharField.
library: OneToOneField to Library.
Apply Database Migrations:

Run migrations to create your model tables: python manage.py makemigrations relationship_app followed by python manage.py migrate.
Implement Sample Queries:

Prepare a Python script query_samples.py in the relationship_app directory. This script should contain the query for each of the following of relationship:
Query all books by a specific author.
List all books in a library.
Retrieve the librarian for a library.
Repo:

GitHub repository: Alx_DjangoLearnLab
Directory: django-models
File: models.py, query_samples.py
 
1. Django Views and URL Configuration
mandatory
Objective: Develop proficiency in creating both function-based and class-based views in Django, and configuring URL patterns to handle web requests effectively. This task will help you understand different ways to define views and manage URL routing in Django.

Task Description:
In your existing Django project, enhance the relationship_app by adding new views that display information about books and libraries. Implement both function-based and class-based views to handle these displays and configure the URL patterns to route these views correctly.

Steps:
Implement Function-based View:

Create a function-based view in relationship_app/views.py that lists all books stored in the database.
This view should render a simple text list of book titles and their authors.
Implement Class-based View:

Create a class-based view in relationship_app/views.py that displays details for a specific library, listing all books available in that library.
Utilize Django’s ListView or DetailView to structure this class-based view.
Configure URL Patterns:

Edit relationship_app/urls.py to include URL patterns that route to the newly created views. Make sure to link both the function-based and class-based views.
Create Templates (Optional for Display):

For a more structured output, using the code below as templates for each view to render the information in HTML format instead of plain text.
Template for Listing Books (list_books.html):
This template will be used by the function-based view to display a list of all books.

<!-- list_books.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>List of Books</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Books Available:</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for book in books %}
        <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author.name }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
Template for Displaying Library Details (library_detail.html):
This template will be used by the class-based view to show details of a specific library, including all books available in that library.

<!-- library_detail.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Library Detail</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Library: {{ library.name }}</h1>
    <h2>Books in Library:</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for book in library.books.all %}
        <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author.name }} (Published {{ book.publication_year }})</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

GitHub repository: Alx_DjangoLearnLab
Directory: django-models
 
2. Implementing User Authentication in Django
mandatory
Objective: Develop the ability to manage user authentication within a Django application. This task focuses on setting up user login, logout, and registration functionalities using Django’s built-in authentication system.

Task Description:
Enhance your relationship_app by adding user authentication features. Implement views and templates for user login, logout, and registration to demonstrate how Django manages user sessions and permissions.

Steps:
Setup User Authentication Views:

Utilize Django’s built-in views and forms for handling user authentication. You will need to create views for user login, logout, and registration.
Create Templates for Authentication:

Provide HTML templates for each authentication action (login, logout, and registration). Templates will be provided, allowing you to focus on backend integrations. Below is the recommended templates structure:
relationship_app/

│── templates/

│ ├── relationship_app/

│ │ ├── login.html

│ │ ├── register.html

│ │ ├── logout.html

Configure URL Patterns:

Define URL patterns in relationship_app/urls.py to link to the authentication views.
Test Authentication Functionality:

Ensure that users can register, log in, and log out.
Provided HTML Templates:
Login Template (login.html):

<!-- login.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Login</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/styles.css' %}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Login</h1>
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
    <a href="{% url 'register' %}">Register</a>
</body>
</html>
Logout Template (logout.html):

<!-- logout.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Logout</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>You have been logged out</h1>
    <a href="{% url 'login' %}">Login again</a>
</body>
</html>
Registration Template (register.html):

<!-- register.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Register</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/styles.css' %}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Register</h1>
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Register</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
